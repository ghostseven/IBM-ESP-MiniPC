# IBM ESP32 MINI PC

This is a fork of the software running on [esp32retropc](https://github.com/eps32retropc/arduino) a tiny retro IBM PC by chrismaddahl.

The original design and concept it completely theirs and I claim no ownership to it. The 3D printable files are available here: [Tiny Retro IBM PC](https://makerworld.com/en/models/2380814-tiny-retro-ibm-pc-oled-hacker-matrix-pong-snake#profileId-2607098)
